        <p>
          Thank you for joining us for our fun family-friendly event open to 
          runners, walkers, and canicrossers* (yes—people brought their dogs!). 
          Whether participants were chasing a personal best, 
          enjoying a morning stroll, or letting their pups lead the way, 
          there was a place for everyone at the starting line.
        </p>

        <p>
          All proceeds support the Nikki Cozzi-Carso Scholarship Fund, which 
          provides financial aid to local Catholic school students. The funds 
          help continue Nikki’s legacy by ensuring children in our community 
          have access to a faith-based education rooted in academic excellence, 
          compassion, and service.
        </p>
