          runners, walkers, and canicrossers* (yes—bring your dog along!). 
          Whether you’re chasing a personal best, enjoying a morning stroll, 
          or letting your pup lead the way, there’s a place for you at the 
          starting line.

          All proceeds support the Nikki Cozzi-Carso Scholarship Fund, which 
          provides financial aid to local Catholic school students. The fund 
          helps continue Nikki’s legacy by ensuring children in our community 
          have access to a faith-based education rooted in academic excellence, 
          compassion, and service.
